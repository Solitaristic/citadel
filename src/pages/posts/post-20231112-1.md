# Starting up the site
Today I spent the day getting familiar with the static site builder [Astro](https://astro.build). It seems pretty straightforward, very composable and easy to set up. I'm working on the site layout and styling first, tomorrow I'll work on getting the server set up to host it, and possibly get it deployed.
