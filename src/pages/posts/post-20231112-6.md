# Getting this place set up
Having my own site seems like something I've always worked on locally, but never bothered to get off the ground. I had 
a webcomic ages ago when I was a teenager, but got distracted with life and let fizzle out. If nothing else this will
maybe get me to focus on some projects I've wanted to get done.
